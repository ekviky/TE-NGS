# Transposable Element Next Generation Sequencing

## About
Genomics tools for TE-enriched next generation sequencing and detection of active transposable elements  

1. molecular genomics protocol for generating TE-enriched NGS libraries   
- detailed procedures [protocol](#)  
2. computational pipeline for detecting TE insertions 

TE calling algorithm consists of two principle steps:  
 (i) clustering on genomic coordinates  
 (ii) annotation via comparison to public and local TE databases

## Implementation  
TE-NGS is implemented in R and distributed using [packrat](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat) for management of packages, dependencies, etc. The snapshot is built on R version 3.1.2.  

R tool employs the following packages:  
- Rsamtools for bam manipulation  
- GenomicRanges for manipulation of genomic coordinates  
- Biostrings for fast implementation of regular expression pattern matching  
- data.table for binary search   

The R script requires the following inputs:
- seq_opt_table.txt # a file describing the experimental conditions per sample, eg sample ID, index, primer  
- path to bam directory # a directory containing bam(s) generated by TE-NGS workflow  
- cluster distance (bp) # minimum distance required between neighboring genomic clusters, 201 recommended  
- mode # one of [test,sample] indicating the run mode: test to generate TE calls on NA12878 bams provided in /test; sample for generating TE calls on new sample  

## Getting started  

Navigate to /scripts where packrat snapshot is built 
 
    $ cd scripts

First time launching R, packrat will build the local library of required packages and dependencies bundled in /packrat/src  

ensure packrat is on  

    > packrat::on()

Check that packrat is up to date 
 
    > packrat::status()

Run the script to generate TE calls  
    
    $ R --no-restore --no-save --no-readline --quiet < R_get_TE_calls_v0.1.r --args ../test/ ../test/seq_opt_table.txt 201 test


## Distribution
Along with the source code several additional files are provided:   

/annotations/polyTEdb - an extensive local database of polymorhic TE compiled from public databases and TE protocols (list references)  

/examples/NA12878_TE-NGS_calls_annotated_v0.1.bed
all TE calls made for NA12878 and results described in manuscript
